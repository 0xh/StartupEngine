* Content Management, Marketing Automation, and Analytics all work out-of-the-box, freeing you to **focus on running your business or developing your business/product**. No plugins to install. Just enter your account information and you're good to go.

* Create a beautiful website easily. No custom-coding required, but since it's completely Open-Source, you can modify or distribute it however you want.

* No vendor lock-in like you might have with services like Instapage, LeadPages, Wix, etc.

* **Automatic updates** via Github & Heroku. No need to pay for server automation services like Jekins, DeployBot, CodeShip, etc.

* Don't have funding? It's ok, you can **run SitePress on your own at little or no cost**.
 
* You're not on your own. **Paid professional support is available when you need it**.
