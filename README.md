# Strategic Benefits
* SitePress is **designed specifically for the needs of a startup** (unlike Wordpress, Ghost, and other open-source CMS offerings.)

* Stop wasting time and effort making your own CMS or modifying another one to suit your needs. SitePress leverages the latest technologies, practices, and services, so you can **focus on running your business**.

* **Custom coding not required.** No plugins to install. Just enter your account information and go.

* **No worries about vendor lock-in** like you might have with services like Instapage, LeadPages, Wix, etc.

* **Automatic updates** via Github & Heroku. No need to pay for server automation services like Jekins, DeployBot, CodeShip, etc.

* Don't have funding? It's ok, you can **run SitePress on your own at little or no cost**.
 
* You're not on your own. **Paid professional support is available when you need it**.

* **Launch your site/business/campaign in under 5 minutes**. 

# Deploying

## Requirements
At the minimum, you will need a free [Contentful](https://contentful.com) account to manage your content on SitePress.

Simply specify your account credentials (Space ID, API Key, and Management Token) during deployment.

## Deploy to Heroku
Click the button below to deploy a new instance of SitePress to Heroku instantly.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/luckyrabbitllc/SitePress)

## Import Default Content
After deploying, you will need to import the default content to your Contentful space. 

Connect to your SitePress instance using the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)

```
$ heroku run bash --app $yourHerokuAppName
```

```
$ npm install contentful-import
```

```
$ php artisan command:ImportDefaultSpace
```

Your Contentful space is now populated with content.

Simply edit the existing pages or create new ones to administrate your site.
